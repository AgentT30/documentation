# Service Classes

Note: Not to be confused with [*Container services*](di.md).

Services are entry points for business logic. You can write business logic right in a service class or delegate it inside the service to another classes.

Controllers are supposed to have little code. Usually a controller action calls some service method.

The **main feature** of service classes that they can be re-defined in `Modules` or `Custom` directories.

Locations of service classes:

* `application/Espo/Services/`
* `application/Espo/Modules/{moduleName}/Services/`
* `custom/Espo/Custom/Services/`

Service instances are created by the *serviceFactory* (available as a container service, hence can be injected to the controller). [Dependencies](di.md) for service classes can be defined in a constructor or with *Aware* interfaces.

Note that you need to **clear cache** after creating a new service class.

To **customize** an existing service you need to create a class in the custom directory and extend it from the existing one. It's also possible to customize within a module directory. Make sure that the *order* param of your module is higher than the value of the module of the extended service.

**Important**: Since v6.0 it's not recomended to create custom service classes for your business logic. Create a class in any namespace you like (inside your module). Use the dependency injection to require this class in your custom controller (your class will be passed to the constructor of your controller).


## Record service

Operations (CRUD and others) over entities (records) are handled by Record service class `Espo\Services\Record`.

If there's a service class with a name that matches the name of the entity type, then that service class will be used as a record service class. It's supposed that that class extends base `Espo\Services\Record` class. Example: `Espo\Services\User` is treated as a Record service for the *User* entity type.


Main methods of the Record service class:

* read - get an entity
* create - create an entity
* update - update an entity
* delete - delete an entity
* find - get a list of entities, used by list view
* findLinked - get a list of related entities, used by relationship panels
* findDuplicates
* loadAdditionalFields - to load additional fields for an entity before returning it, for detail view
* loadAdditionalFieldsForList - to load additiona fields, for list view

Hook-methods:

* beforeCreateEntity
* afterCreateEntity
* beforeUpdateEntity
* afterUpdateEntity
* beforeDeleteEntity
* afterDeletEntity

### Extending existing Record service

Service `custom/Espo/Custom/Services/Opportunity.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace Espo\Custom\Services;

use Espo\ORM\Entity;

use Espo\Modules\Crm\Services\Opportunity as BaseOpportunity

class Opportunity extends BaseOpportunity
{
    // load additional fields for detail view
    public function loadAdditionalFields(Entity $entity)
    {
        parent::loadAdditionalFields($entity);

        // here do some fetching

        $entity->set('myNotStorableField', $someValue);
    }

    protected function afterDeleteEntity(Entity $entity, $data)
    {
        // do something after entity is deleted
    }
}
```

You can also extend a service in the *Module* directory. The *order* of your module needs to be greated than the order of the module your are extending from.

## Creating new service class (example)

Note: Not recommended since v6.0.

Controller `custom/Espo/Custom/Controllers/Opportunity.php`:

```php
<?php

use Espo\Core\{
    ServiceFactory,
    Api\Request,
};

namespace Espo\Custom\Controllers;

class SomeController
{
    protected $serviceFactory;

    public function __construct(ServiceFactory $serviceFactory)
    {
        $this->serviceFactory = $serviceFactory;
    }

    public function postActionHello(Request $request)
    {
        $service = $this->serviceFactory->create('HelloTest');

        $data = $request->getParsedBody();

        return $service->doSomething($data);
    }
}

```

Service `custom/Espo/Custom/Services/HelloTest.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace Espo\Custom\Services;

use Espo\Core\{
    Exceptions\BadRequest,
    Exceptions\Forbidden,
    Exceptions\NotFound,
    Acl,
    ORM\EntityManager,
};

use StdClass;

class HelloTest
{
    protected $acl;
    protected $entityManager;

    public function __construct(Acl $acl, EntityManager $entityManager)
    {
        $this->acl = $acl;
        $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
    }

    public function doSomething(StdClass $data) : StdClass
    {
        if (!isset($data->id)) {
            throw new BadRequest();
        }

        $em = $this->entityManager;
        $acl = $this->acl;

        $opportunity = $em->getEntity('Opportunity', $data->id);

        if (!$opportunity) {
            throw new NotFound();
        }

        if (!$acl->check($opportunity, 'edit')) {
            throw new Forbidden();
        }

        $opportunity->set('stage', 'Closed Won');
        $opportunity->set('probability', 100);

        $em->saveEntity($opportunity);

        return $opportunity->getValueMap();
    }
}
```
