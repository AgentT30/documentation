# Dashboards

All internal users can manage their dashboards: add or remove dashlets and tabs, edit dashlet options.

Admin can edit dashboards of other users. On the user detail view, click Preferences from the dropdown at the top-right corner. There, you can find *Dashboard Layout*.

Users can **reset** their dashboard layout to the default. On Preferences edit view, click *Reset Dashboard to Default* from the dropdown next to the *Edit* button. Admin can reset dashboards of other users.

Dashlets can be **resized** by dragging the lower-right corner.

## System default dashboard

The default dashboard layout will be applied to all new users. It can be changed at Administration > User Interface > Dashboard Layout.

## Dashboard Templates

Available for admin at Administration > Dashboard Templates. Dashboard templates provide the ability to deploy a specific dashboard layout to multiple users. It's possible to deploy for all users of a specific team.


## Portal dashboard

On the edit view of the portal record, you can define its default dashboard layout. It will be applied to all portal users unless a user has a specific *Dashboard Template*.

When editing *Portal User*, you can specify a dashboard template for the user. This template will override the default template of the portal.
